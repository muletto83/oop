'''
Building walls in Age of Dragons can be expensive,
the larger and stronger the wall, the more it costs.
Complete the .get_cost() method on the Wall class. 
It should return the cost of a wall,
where the cost is its armor multiplied by its height.

class Wall:
    armor = 10
    height = 5

        # Calculate the cost of the wall
        # Cost is defined as armor multiplied by height
        return self.armor * self.height
